<p>Leslie Jamison’s essay on gaslighting offered an excellent and comprehensive review of the topic (“Crazy-Making,” April 8th). As a longtime practicing clinical psychologist, I agreed enthusiastically as I read—that is, until I came to Gila Ashtor’s psychoanalytic interpretation of gaslighting as a dynamic dyad that includes a gaslighter and a second “voluntary” participant, i.e., the person being gaslit. Patients can feel deeply recognized when a therapist confirms their belief that a parent or a partner has been undermining them. Withholding that validation, as Ashtor suggests doing, can be tantamount to remaining silent when a victim of domestic abuse displays her bruises. Sometimes a victim is a victim; a mental-health professional can provide a potentially life-changing affirmation when she confirms that reality.</p>

<p>I have just one thing to add to Jamison’s finely observed piece. In contemporary infant- and child-development research, the idea of gaslighting has a parallel in the acquisition of what is known as “epistemic trust”: our capacity to learn new information from people we deem trustworthy. This emerges in caregiver-infant interactions. Our caregivers and families may confuse us through both verbal and nonverbal communication, and that can contribute, later in life, to difficulty in reading social cues and a tendency to doubt our own beliefs. No one is to blame; the point is that our minds begin forming during our earliest social interactions, which will shape our ability to process information for the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>In her article on gaslighting, Jamison cites the 1944 film “Gaslight,” directed by George Cukor, as the source for the term, and points out that the film was based on Patrick Hamilton’s 1938 stage play, “Gas Light.” She does not mention, though, that a British film adaptation of the same play, directed by Thorold Dickinson, was released in 1940. (The cast and crew were not well known to audiences in the U.S., where the film had a very limited run, under the title “Angel Street.”) When M-G-M remade the movie four years later, with a more prominent director and a cast of stars such as Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, and Joseph Cotten, studio executives attempted to destroy all extant prints of the 1940 version, and may have hoped to destroy the original negative, too. I find it ironic that the story of the making of “Gaslight” itself resembles a tale of gaslighting: an attempt to erase an artistic product from the collective consciousness and replace it with a different, ostensibly “original” version.</p>

<h2>Mighty Fine Dining</h2>
<p>As a gourmand, I found Lauren Collins’s piece on the French all-you-can-eat restaurant Les Grands Buffets both educational and incredibly appetizing (“Feast Mode,” April 8th). As I salivated my way through the article, my thoughts turned to the American equivalent, the chain Golden Corral, which Collins mentions. Having survived <em class="small">COVID</em>, Golden Corral is going strong, with an amazing range of comfort foods and an abundance of desserts. Many locations also serve breakfast; this boy from Brooklyn particularly loves the biscuits and sausage gravy, with two eggs over easy on top. I have no idea how the place does it, without reservations and at such reasonable prices.</p><!--{{ad_position}}-->
