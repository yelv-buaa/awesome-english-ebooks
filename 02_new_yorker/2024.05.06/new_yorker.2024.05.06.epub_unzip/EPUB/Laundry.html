<p>The baby’s dragged the sheets to the kitchen<br/>
and now she’s stuffing them in the washer,<br/>
one hand lifting a wad of yellow cotton,<br/>
the other reaching down for more and more. Breathing heavy,<br/>
she’s feeding vast swaths by the armful,<br/>
bent halfway into the mouth of the machine,<br/>
a strip of skin exposed where her shirt’s ridden up,<br/>
an edge of diaper sticking out of her pants.<br/>
Who can watch a child and not feel fear<br/>
like static in the background or a tinnitus you try to ignore.<br/>
This morning, in the <em>Times</em>, I saw the galaxy <em class="small">LEDA</em> 2046648—<br/>
each spiral arm distinct and bright against the dark ink. Light<br/>
from a billion years ago, just as the first<br/>
multicellular life emerged on Earth.<br/>
What are the not-quite-two years of this intent creature<br/>
in the sweep of time? Her quadriceps and scapula,<br/>
the alveoli of her lungs, twenty-seven bones of her hand<br/>
that evolved from the fin of an ancient fish.<br/>
And her scribbly hair sticking up from her first ponytail.<br/>
When she was in her mother’s body,<br/>
the California fires turned the air a smoky topaz<br/>
and the sun glowed orange on the kitchen wall.<br/>
Last month the floodwaters rose and seeped under the door.<br/>
Still, there must be time for this, to watch her—<br/>
hands deep into the doing, she’s wedded<br/>
to the things of this world.<br/>
When she stands, her sleeve slips down<br/>
and she pushes it up like any woman at work.</p></div>
